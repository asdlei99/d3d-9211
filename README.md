# Direct3D 9 to 11 Texture Sharing Demo

An Producer-Consumer based sample application where frames are generated by a Direct3D 9 producer, and rendered into a Direct3D 11 consumer (scene).

## Build Instructions

1. If you don't have it already - install CMake and Visual Studio 2017
    * VS 2017 Community Edition is fine - just make sure to install C/C++ development tools
    
2. Run the gen_vs2017.bat script.

> Note: if you're building for x86 you will need to modify gen_vs2017.bat to specify the correct generator for CMake

3. Open the build/d3d-9211.sln solution in Visual Studio

4. Build the **ALL_BUILD** project

5. Run the **d3d-9211.exe** application

## Usage

The scene dimensions can be specified as a command line argument: (--size=1920x1080 for example).  By default it will choose a resolution that can fit on screen.
